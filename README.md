# Iris Species Classification Using Random Forest

## Aim
The primary aim of this project is to implement a Random Forest classification algorithm on the Iris dataset to classify different species of iris flowers based on the features of their petals and sepals.

## Objective
- Apply the Random Forest classifier to the Iris dataset.
- Demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods in classification tasks.
- Evaluate the accuracy of predictions and the importance of different features in the dataset.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with four features each:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which includes three classes:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the Iris dataset and convert it into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
3. **Model Training:** Train the Random Forest classifier on the dataset.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, feature importance, and other metrics.
5. **Conclusion:** Summarize the results and provide insights into the classification performance.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the required libraries are installed.
 **Run this command on command prompt(cmd)** to your local machine:
   ```bash 
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run all cells sequentially
5. **Important:** Load three images of iris flowers onto your device for visualization and analysis in the notebook..


## Conclusion
This project showcases the use of the Random Forest algorithm for classifying iris species and emphasizes the importance of feature selection and model evaluation in machine learning projects.
